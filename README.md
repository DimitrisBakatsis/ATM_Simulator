# ATM Simulator - Python

A console-based ATM simulator implementing core banking operations like withdrawals, deposits, and balance checks using Object-Oriented Programming principles in Python.

## Features
- User authentication (PIN-based login)
- Cash withdrawal and deposit with balance validation
- Transaction history tracking
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Python:** OOP (Classes, Methods), Control Flow, Error Handling
- **Software Design:** Modular structure, user input validation

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
2. Download `atm_simulator.py`
3. Run in terminal: `python atm_simulator.py`

## Purpose
This project was developed to solidify my understanding of core Python concepts and OOP principles, which are fundamental for backend development and data engineering roles.
